# Setup Guide

## Quick Start

No external setup required! This is a static portfolio website.

## Customization

1. Open `frontend/app/page.tsx`
2. Find the `PORTFOLIO_CONFIG` object at the top
3. Replace placeholder values marked with `[YOUR_...]` with your actual information:
   - `name` - Your full name
   - `title` - Your job title
   - `tagline` - A catchy one-liner about you
   - `email` - Your contact email
   - `location` - Your city/location
   - `social` - Your GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter URLs
   - `projects` - Your featured projects
   - `experience` - Your work history
   - `skills` - Your technical skills

## Optional: Custom Images

Replace project images in the `PORTFOLIO_CONFIG.projects` array with your own project screenshots hosted on any image CDN.
